## What is DevOps? üöÄ

DevOps is a set of practices that merge software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to enhance collaboration, automate workflows, and improve the speed and reliability of software delivery. It focuses on continuous integration, continuous deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), security, monitoring, and automation.

### Why DevOps? ü§î

DevOps aims to:

- Improve collaboration between development and operations teams.
- Automate repetitive tasks to increase efficiency.
- Enhance software reliability and reduce deployment failures.
- Enable faster releases with continuous delivery.

### Key Areas of DevOps üîë

1. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automates software building, testing, and deployment to ensure rapid and reliable releases.
2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Manages infrastructure using code for consistency, scalability, and automation.
3. **Monitoring & Logging**: Helps track system performance and detect issues proactively.
4. **Security (DevSecOps)**: Integrates security practices into DevOps workflows to ensure secure applications and infrastructure.
5. **Cloud Providers ([AWS, Azure, GCP](#leading-cloud-providers-))**: Provide cloud-based infrastructure and services to enhance scalability and performance.

## 1. Cloud Computing ‚òÅÔ∏è

### What is Cloud Computing? üöÄ

- Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics over the internet (‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù).
- It allows users to access and store data, run applications, and leverage IT resources on demand without owning physical infrastructure.
- Cloud computing offers scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency, making it a key enabler for modern businesses and technologies.

### Key Benefits of Cloud Computing üåç

- **Scalability**: Easily scale resources up or down as needed.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for the resources you use, reducing capital expenditure.
- **Flexibility**: Access computing resources from anywhere.
- **Security**: Cloud providers implement strong security measures to protect data.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Cloud-based backups ensure quick recovery from failures.

### Cloud Computing Service Models üõ†Ô∏è

Cloud services are typically categorized into three main models:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** üè†

   - Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
   - Examples: Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure VMs (see [Leading Cloud Providers](#leading-cloud-providers-)).

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** üõ†Ô∏è

   - Offers a platform for developing, running, and managing applications.
   - Examples: Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Services (see [Leading Cloud Providers](#leading-cloud-providers-)).

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)** üñ•Ô∏è

   - Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.
   - Examples: Google Workspace, Dropbox, Salesforce.

### Cloud Deployment Models üåê

1. **Public Cloud** ‚Äì Services are offered to multiple customers over the internet.
2. **Private Cloud** ‚Äì Resources are dedicated to a single organization.
3. **Hybrid Cloud** ‚Äì A combination of public and private cloud solutions.
4. **Multi-Cloud** ‚Äì Utilizing multiple cloud providers for different services.

## 2. Docker üê≥

### What is Docker? üö¢

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments.

<img src="https://github.com/deepak404found/devops-notes/blob/main/images/docker-intro.jpeg" alt="Docker Introduction" height="400" />

- Docker allows developers to package applications into containers, which can run on any system that has Docker installed. This eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem and simplifies the deployment process.
- Containers are lightweight, portable, and can be easily shared across different environments, making them ideal for microservices architectures and cloud-native applications.
- Docker provides a rich ecosystem of tools and services, including Docker Hub (a registry for sharing container images), Docker Compose (for defining multi-container applications), and Docker Swarm (for orchestrating containers).
- Docker is widely used in DevOps practices to streamline the development and deployment process, enabling continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

For more information, visit the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/).

### Why Use Docker? ü§î

- **Portability**: Run the same application on different environments without modifications.
- **Isolation**: Ensures that applications run in separate containers without conflicts.
- **Efficiency**: Containers are lightweight compared to virtual machines (VMs).
- **Scalability**: Easily scale applications with container orchestration tools.

### Docker Architecture üèóÔ∏è

Docker consists of the following components:

- **Docker Engine**: The core of Docker, responsible for running containers.
- **Docker Image**: A lightweight, stand-alone package containing everything needed to run an application.
- **Docker Container**: A running instance of a Docker image.
- **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based registry for sharing container images.
- **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and running multi-container applications.
  
### Common Docker Commands üíª

```sh
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Pull an image from Docker Hub
docker pull nginx

# Run a container
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx

# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop a running container
docker stop <container_id>

# Remove a container
docker rm <container_id>

# Remove an image
docker rmi <image_id>
```

---

### Docker Compose üèóÔ∏è

Docker Compose allows you to define multi-container applications using a YAML file.

Example `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```

To start the application, run:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the application, run:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

---

### Dockerfile üìú

A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. Here's a simple example:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image

FROM node:14

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package.json .

RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Build the Docker image

```sh
docker build -t my-node-app .
```

### Run the Docker container

```sh
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
```

---

### Docker Volumes üíæ

Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. They are stored outside the container filesystem, allowing data to persist even if the container is removed.

To create a volume:

```sh
docker volume create my-volume
```

To use a volume with a container:

```sh
docker run -d -v my-volume:/data my-node-app
```

---

### Docker Networking üåê

Docker provides several networking options:

- **Bridge**: Default network mode; containers can communicate with each other.
- **Host**: Shares the host network stack.
- **Overlay**: Used in Docker Swarm for multi-host networking.
